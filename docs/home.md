# Hi | Cześć
I'm Michał Sujka, a husband, a father, and a builder. I love to build things for others to enjoy. Computer code is the tool I am most competent with, but I have also built things in the physical world (ask me about the time I built a kitchen for my wife if you are looking for a great conversation starter). 

# Background
## Personal
I grew up in rural Poland. From my bedroom window, I could see apple trees, wheat fields and hills covered by forests. I spent many summer weekends mowing our house lawn or mountain biking. The winter months were more computer time, where I saw the explosive growth of this industry unwinding in front of my own eyes. 
I studied electronic engineering in Polish, my native language, at the University of Science and Technology in Wroclaw, Poland. After graduation, I briefly worked in Poland, but in search of something NEW, in 2007, I packed my bag, and with one thousand dollars in my pocket, I boarded a low-cost airline plane to London Gatwick. My first few years in global and diverse London were like drinking from a fire hose, and this experience was only amplified after I got a job at Bloomberg, a fast-growing, multicultural, incredibly successful US company.

## Professional
I still remember my first weeks at Bloomberg. The office was like no other I had seen before. There was a constant sound of Bloomberg News in the background, frequently interrupted by prospective sales announcements. There were screens on every floor showing the faces of new joiners and the number of Bloomberg Terminals sold this year. In the first two weeks after joining my team, I wrote and released my code to production, which would take months, if not years, in the other companies I have worked with before. It felt like I had boarded a rocket ship.

My journey at Bloomberg has been an intense learning experience, providing firsthand insights into the dynamics of lasting companies. I've witnessed the power of scale, network effects, vertical integration, and the impact of customer-centricity. Even though we are now more than 40 years old company, we are not done yet.

It remains DAY ONE.

# Running and Reading
> “The keys to life are running and reading. When you're running, there's a little person that talks to you and says, "Oh I'm tired. My lung's about to pop. I'm so hurt. There's no way I can possibly continue." You want to quit. If you learn how to defeat that person when you're running. You will learn how to not quit when things get hard in your life. For reading: there have been gazillions of people that have lived before all of us. There's no new problem you could have--with your parents, with school, with a bully. There's no new problem that someone hasn't already had and written about it in a book.”
― Will Smith

I love running and enjoy reading [books](bookshelf), blogs, newspapers, transcripts, annual reports, letters, memos, blogs.
