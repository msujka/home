# Hi | Cześć
I'm Michał, pronounced as Me-how. 

# Three things get my energy going

## Building
Computer code is the tool I am most competent with, but I have also built things in the physical world (ask me about the experience of building a kitchen for my wife if you are looking for a great conversation starter). 

In my professional life, I designed and built a variety of products, mainly for financial professionals, but not only. The list includes things like order, risk, and portfolio analytics REST APIs, large-scale enterprise trading systems, hedge accounting software, Bloomberg Terminal OVML<GO> derivatives calculator, financial stock exchange connectors and parsers, Siemens set-top boxes, and PURE internet-connected radios.

In my work, I set high standards and enjoy sweeting the details — if something is worth doing, it is worth doing well.

## Investing
My investment strategy can be described as global equity with an infinite holding period. Sales that happen sometimes are an admission of error. The portfolio is concentrated with less than fifteen holdings, and purchases are done infrequently. I enjoy figuring out businesses, and when I find one per year that I can understand and feel excited about its future prospects, that is a good year. 

An extra benefit of benign value investors is the community surrounding the activity. The activity attracts people with principles and values similar to mine, and I enjoy meeting them during Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meetings in Omaha, VALUEx, and [RV Capital investors meeting](https://youtu.be/8dscb_O7Hw0) in Switzerland.

## Biking
I grew up in a small village in Poland. I could see apple trees, fields, and hills covered by forests from my bedroom window. I spent many summer weekends [cross-country biking](https://youtu.be/5AMuD66m2jk) in the nearby woods and hills. Through the years, I have tried surfing, sailing, dancing, piano, diving, motorbiking, and travelling, but mountain biking is the only activity I return to yearly. And in winter, when it is too cold to go biking, I enjoy [skiing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oj6WU6JMgQ). 

# Getting in touch
The easiest way to get in touch with me electronically is via LinkedIn. I am open to connect with everyone so don’t hesitate to reach out [@MichalSujka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michalsujka/)

Every year I attend some events in person and it is a great opportunity to connect with me in person. I typically attend [RV Capital](https://www.rvcapital.ch/) investors meeting in Engelberg, Switzerland, the [Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/sharehold.html) in Omaha, USA, [AWS Summit London](https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/emea/london/), and [APIdays London](https://www.apidays.global/london/).
